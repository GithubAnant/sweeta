I've been seeing Twitter for the past 2 days and it's way wayy too full with Sora stuff
lowkey want access though haha

it's crazy how many people get fooled from the video tbh, especially on insta - saw so many sora videos on my feed with the obvious watermark and people even believed it

lol even replied here

I just have this random idea
a large "secure" part of using this by OpenAI is THE watermark 

but really, how hard would it be to remove it?

I mean
you really probably only need opencv to do it honestly

I got a principles of AI midsem tomorrow should I really be doing this at 1 am without having studied for it 
eh fuck it 

probably only journalling here in case it works lol, I'll write a blog about it or smth

hm probably gonna get claude to think it's for removing tiktok watermark logos LOL
it's honestly so freakin funny that I got the boilerplate from claude.ai and not from freakin copilot LOL

I'll be honest by the length, it doesn't look promising at all

LMFAOOO what an epic fail


I bet there are some existing solutions we can learn from or tweak tho

hm.

#### Hugging Face Models/ Spaces search

hm nothing that promising tbh

this looks nice

hm not even close honestly

I see a couple but they all exceed the 16gb memory, classic spaces problem

this colab is fun
https://colab.research.google.com/github/camenduru/text-to-video-synthesis-colab/blob/main/watermark_remover_gradio.ipynb

build errors, I cba bro

let's just clone this and see what's up and if we can tweak it ig

sidenote: claude 4.5 is insane holy shit
hm why not let's just use gradio code, run it on spaces

just sucks, I'm gonna lock in and stop blogging for a while, brb with an update
