I've been seeing Twitter for the past 2 days and it's way wayy too full with Sora stuff
lowkey want access though haha

it's crazy how many people get fooled from the video tbh, especially on insta - saw so many sora videos on my feed with the obvious watermark and people even believed it

lol even replied here

I just have this random idea
a large "secure" part of using this by OpenAI is THE watermark 

but really, how hard would it be to remove it?

I mean
you really probably only need opencv to do it honestly

I got a principles of AI midsem tomorrow should I really be doing this at 1 am without having studied for it 
eh fuck it 

probably only journalling here in case it works lol, I'll write a blog about it or smth

hm probably gonna get claude to think it's for removing tiktok watermark logos LOL
it's honestly so freakin funny that I got the boilerplate from claude.ai and not from freakin copilot LOL
