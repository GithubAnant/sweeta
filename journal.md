I've been seeing Twitter for the past 2 days and it's way wayy too full with Sora stuff
lowkey want access though haha

it's crazy how many people get fooled from the video tbh, especially on insta - saw so many sora videos on my feed with the obvious watermark and people even believed it

lol even replied here

I just have this random idea
a large "secure" part of using this by OpenAI is THE watermark 

but really, how hard would it be to remove it?
